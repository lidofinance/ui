    Liquid staking protocols allow users to earn staking rewards without locking

    deposit staking tokens and receive tradable liquid tokens in return. The DAO

      <p>
        When staking with Lido, users receive stETH tokens on a 1:1 basis
        representing their staked ETH. stETH balances can be used like regular
        ETH to earn yields and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis
        to reflect your ETH staking rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups or
        minimum deposits when staking with Lido.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using Lido, users receive secure staking rewards in real-time,
        allowing for participation in the securing of Ethereum without the
        associated risks and downside potential.
      </p>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion summary='How is Lido secure?'>
      <p>Lido is a secure liquid staking solution for a number of reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open-sourcing & continuous review of all code.</li>
        <li>
          Committee of elected, best-in-class validators to minimise staking
          risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of non-custodial staking service to eliminate counterparty risk.
        </li>
        <li>Use of DAO for governance decisions & to manage risk factors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Usually when staking ETH you choose only one validator. In the case of
        Lido you stake across many validators, minimising your staking risk.
