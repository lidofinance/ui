# Lido UI Components v4

> React components (v4) for Lido Finance projects. (Released February 2025)

Check out our Storybook at [https://ui.lido.fi](https://ui.lido.fi)

For release a new version of the library you need to create a commit with `!` like this - `feat!: ui v4`

## Breaking Changes

`useBreakpoint` has been deleted, because getting styles in js is a legacy of styled-components, but the library has switched to module-css. This can be created locally in your project.

## Getting Started

1. Simply add `lido-ui` to your dependencies:

```bash
yarn add @lidofinance/lido-ui
```

2. Import Lido theme provider and wrap your components in `_app.js`:

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from '@lidofinance/lido-ui'

function App({ Component }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Component />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

3. Import styles into your `_app.js` file:
```tsx
import '@lidofinance/lido-ui/index.css';
```

4. To use typography classes across your application, you need to import the provided CSS styles for typography.
Ð¡ss variables are initially embedded in the `index.css` file. If you want to use ready-made classes with styles, you need to import an additional css file.
Insert the following line at the top of `_app.js` file to import the typography styles
```tsx
import '@lidofinance/lido-ui/styles/typography.css';
```

## Usage

Simply import any components and use in your project:

```js
import { Button } from '@lidofinance/lido-ui'
```

## Developing

- `yarn dev` - Start Storybook locally to start developing components.
- `yarn build` - Build all components.
- `yarn test` - Run tests across components.
- `yarn lint` - Run eslint across components.

```

2. To get started, install the dependencies:
